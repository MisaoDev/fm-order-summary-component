## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

#### CSS

- Gained some experience using custom properties / CSS variables.
- Learned about [fallback colors](https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint/wiki/Require-fallback-colors), and started adding them!
- Tinkered with flex (just started learning).
- Learned the horrible truth that is CSSLint bugs.

#### Misc

- I'm starting to remember git commands by heart.


### Continued development

I want to start using CSS variables a lot more. And become more used to the git initialization process.
